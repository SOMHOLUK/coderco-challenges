# Challenge 1

## Scenario:

You're the new DevOps hire at a startup. They've given you a fresh Linux VM and asked you to build a production-ready Linux service setup for their Python app. But there’s no infra — you have to do it all.

Prerequisites
A fresh Linux VM. We recommend using Killercoda to get started. Or you can use your own Linux machine (AWS EC2 etc)
Challenge Requirements:

You must create a setup.sh (or Makefile) that does all of the following:

## 1. User & Permissions

Create a user called appuser (non-root) Creating a User on the Linux module
Create a directory /opt/coderco-app Creating directories
Place a server.py file in it (can be a simple http.server). The server.py is located here and the .env file is located here
Give appuser full access to /opt/coderco-app only - Setting Permissions
Make sure no other user (except root) can read/write to it

# The steps I have taken to solve the "user & permissions" challenge can be seen in the screenshots below:
